# ARCore VR Controller
An OpenVR driver that accepts input from your android device with 6DOF.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
1. Download the arcore.zip and drag the enclosed file into the drivers folder of your SteamVR installation. Use the browse local files feature of steam if you don't know where your installation is.<br/>
2. Download the apk and install it on your device.<br/>
3. Make sure your android device and computer are on the same network and then connect to your computer's local IP. The IP will be saved once you connect with it once.<br/>
4. Use the calibrate button to connect your phone with your playspace. Align the phone so that the top of it points into the tracker from below. Press calibrate again to set the position.<br/>
5. I just copy and pasted the Oculus controller input file so that it can use those bindings for any game without issue. So to change the bindings, change your Oculus Controller bindings.

<h2>Help</h2>
1. <b>I don't see my controller moving/it is unresponsive:</b> Your phone probably cannot see your computer. Make sure you're on the same network and double check the IP.<br/>
2. <b>I don't see anything when I press calibrate:</b> Look around your playspace. It should spawn slightly in front of where you first opened SteamVR. If you opened SteamVR at your desk, then walked over to another part of the room to play, look back at your desk.<br/>
3. <b>My rotation is f-ed when I calibrate:</b> Angle the phone more vertically when you calibrate. Holding it horizontally can mess it up.<br/>
